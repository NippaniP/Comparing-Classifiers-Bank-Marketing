# Comparing-Classifiers-Bank-Marketing
in this practical application assignment, my goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) on a dataset from ucimlrepo on Bank Marketing outcome. The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns.
